# Phases of Project Implementation

The project life cycle represents the stages a project must go through from the beginning to its end. The project life cycle may vary from one organization to another but in general, it includes the following main phases:

1.  Project Initiation

2.  Project Preparation

3.  Project Implementation

4.  Project Completion.

In a typical consultancy project, there are four major project implementation phases: Inception, Data Collection, Reporting, and post-sign off phases. Each of these phases, in turn, consists of various tasks and sub-tasks as described in the following diagram.

## Major Activities during the Inception Phase
